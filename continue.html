        When I started to learn to make websites with HTML and CSS, I was
        concentrating just on the desktop view. When it was time to make the
        website responsive, things would get really messy and I would get
        frustrated with CSS, and that’s normal. But then I decided to actually
        learn the basics of making a website responsive and I took this free
        course by Kevin Powell called
        <a
          target="_blank"
          href="https://courses.kevinpowell.co/conquering-responsive-layouts"
          >Conquering responsive layouts</a
        >. This was a 21-day challenge and was really easy to complete. The one
        important thing that I learned was to build the mobile UI first.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>WHY MOBILE-FIRST?</h3>
      <p>
        Trust me, it is really easy to build the mobile UI, actually, it is
        easier than building the desktop UI. When building the mobile UI, as the
        width of the screen is less, the only way to show the content is
        vertical. You can build the mobile UI without even using a
        <strong>flexbox</strong> or a <strong>grid</strong>. When it’s time to
        make the website responsive, you can use the min-width property to set
        the width and apply the styles for desktop view.
      </p>
      <p>
        Building the mobile UI first is practical. When I first tried the
        mobile-first approach, I was surprised at how quickly I could finish
        styling a page. You get a basic layout and from there you can quickly
        make the desktop view and not worry about responsiveness as it is
        already responsive.
      </p>
      <p>
        It saves so much of your time and effort. I remember when I was doing
        the desktop view first and then trying to make it responsive, I would
        just re-write so much of CSS and google stuff and make it
        over-complicated just to align something in the mobile view. Building
        the mobile UI first will make you more confident and you can concentrate
        on the desktop view later.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If you are still wondering if mobile-first is the right approach, then I
        suggest you try it in your next project and I’m sure that you will love
        it and actually enjoy CSS more.
