        I was always a productivity freak but I was never being productive. I
        used to download apps like Tick Tick, Evernote, Forest and would try to
        be productive but I would last just for a few days and completely stop
        being productive. A few weeks ago I really went all in and tried to be
        productive for real this time. This is how It went.
      </p>
      <p>
        I get addicted to games pretty quickly. I was playing Valorant when I
        decided to be productive. So, I deleted the game and it was really tough
        to not play but I soldiered on. I did install it back after a couple of
        weeks but I was feeling so guilty just by the act of installing it again
        that I deleted it even without playing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don’t think I can be 100% productive until I have a deadline for
        something important. For example, in my Engineering 4th semester last
        month, we were informed about lab exams exactly a week before the date
        of the exam. I hadn’t written my record or knew any lab programs but in
        one week I planned every single day so that I can simultaneously
        complete the records and study the programs. Surprisingly, everything
        went according to plan. So, I started giving myself deadlines to
        complete the tasks. Ok, enough about me. My point is that if you feel
        that you aren’t being productive enough, just give yourself a serious
        deadline and write down what you’ll have to do(something you don’t like
        to do) if you don’t complete the task by that deadline.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mobile is one thing that stops you from being productive, so that’s
        where I started making changes. I deleted Instagram, disabled YouTube,
        customized my phone to make it just too boring. Basically, my phone was
        monochrome all over and it worked! I didn’t have apps that distracted me
        and without any valid reason, I wasn’t using the phone much, and my
        screen time, well it plummeted. Just without youtube, I didn’t feel like
        using the phone. If you really can’t live without Instagram or YouTube,
        use the browser version of them on your phone and you will automatically
        use less of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I actually started using the productivity apps the right way. One
        app which I really liked was Forest. You basically set a timer for how
        much time you are gonna concentrate and the app will plant a tree for
        you at that time. If you give up and start using the phone, the tree
        will die and that’s not a good sight. I was focusing for 2 hours and
        didn’t feel like checking the phone at all. So, that’s been my
        experience on being productive and I am continuing these practices
        although I’m not being perfect. One thing I have learned the hard way is
        that not being perfect is perfectly fine. What matters is being
        consistent.
